                    I’m a Product Manager driven by a deep-seated curiosity to make things better. I thrive on turning messy, complex problems into simple, elegant solutions that people genuinely love using. My background sits right at the intersection of tech and humanity; I can talk APIs and system design with engineers, then translate that into a clear, user-centric vision for everyone else.
