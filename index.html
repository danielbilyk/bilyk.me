                    I grew up <a href="https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate-en/#donate-army-card-once" class="hover-link">in Kyiv</a>, moved to Munich at nineteen, and eventually landed in Berlin, where I live now. I work full-time as a product manager, and mix audio for <i>The Ukrainians Media</i> on the side.

                    Outside of work, I nerd out about Macs (and the podcasts that nerd out about Macs), roll out a yoga mat, watch something about cars. Recently I started running, so now I'm training towards 12k. I try to get better at taking photographs.

                     If I have a free minute, I quickly don't have a free minute because I always find something to do. Sometimes thatâ€™s plotting a surprise birthday abroad for a friend who has no idea. Sometimes itâ€™s disappearing into a (pet) project. Sometimes itâ€™s tickets to a concert with my girlfriend. I like doing things â€” though, ironically, I don't like leaving the apartment. Every now and then, one has to.

                    I really want to go to the <i>Arctic Monkeys</i> concert, participate in a go-kart endurance race, and master a pigeon pose. I would also like to own a light-blue Volvo V90.

                    I hope one day russia ceases to exist, I'm able to take a guilt-free May sabbatical, and the work I do makes a difference.

                    Favourite party story: at <i>The National</i> show, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=matt+berninger" class="hover-link">Matt Berninger</a> handed me a pack of Korean breakfast for my birthday. A stranger even got the photo.

                    Whenever I can, I love to travel â€” preferably by car. Cars are awesome.
