                    I love exploring and building things. That can mean anything â€” from running Pixar-inspired home servers to automating podcast production to designing a real-life quest for a friendâ€™s birthday with sending him to another country as a surprise. Iâ€™m endlessly curious about how the world works and always looking for ways to make it a little simpler â€” and hopefully a bit more beautiful.

                <p class="subtitle">
                    Iâ€™m drawn to technology, music, and human stories. Sometimes I write code, sometimes words, but most often I build bridges between people and ideas. Storytelling plays a big role in my life, especially through podcasts.

                <p class="subtitle">
                    My interests include the history of personal computing â€” especially Macintosh computers; the history of cars and motorsport â€” especially Formula 1. Also, lately: videogames, yoga, and light running (I hope to run 10k this year).

                    Whenever I can, I also love to travel â€” preferably by car.
