## Experience

#### Product Manager, Veact GmbH
*Remote | May 2023 – Present*

As Product Owner for a core B2B SaaS platform, I manage the full product lifecycle for multiple development teams, from discovery and roadmap definition to launch and iteration. I led the end-to-end delivery of the 'Customer Hub,' a backend-heavy foundational module, translating user needs into a more intuitive data view. I also designed and shipped a suite of public REST APIs to accelerate internal development. By pioneering the integration of product analytics, I helped establish a data-informed culture where we track key metrics to drive iterative improvements.

#### Product Specialist, Veact GmbH
*Munich, Germany | May 2021 – May 2023*

I owned the delivery of a new landing page module, translating business needs and user feedback into actionable requirements for the engineering team. Collaborating closely with design and development, I managed the product backlog and ensured we shipped features that delivered real customer value. I also improved our internal processes by overhauling our Jira instance and creating a comprehensive knowledge base in Confluence to align teams.

#### Working Student in Operations, Veact GmbH
*Munich, Germany | Jun 2018 – May 2021*

I co-managed a marketing operations pipeline, ensuring the timely delivery of ~10,000 personalized communications monthly. I identified a critical workflow bottleneck and drove the implementation of a centralized tracking system to improve transparency and outcomes. In this role, I served as the communication hub, aligning multiple stakeholders to ensure smooth data and asset handoffs.

#### Freelance Producer & Internal Tool-Maker, The Ukrainians Media
*Remote | 2022 – Present*

I initially joined as a freelance producer for several of the media's podcasts. My role quickly expanded to solving operational challenges, where I developed internal tools and automations (e.g., Slack agents) to streamline editorial workflows. I also managed audio engineering and content distribution.

## Education

#### Technical University of Munich
*B.Sc. Political Science | 2017 – 2022*

I deliberately chose to study political science at a leading technical university to specialize in the intersection of technology, policy, and society. My thesis assessed the impact of the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) on Apple's core platform services.

#### National University «Kyiv Aviation Institute»
*Aircraft Maintenance | 2014 – 2016*

Through my engineering coursework, I developed a foundational understanding of complex systems. I also volunteered at the National Aviation Museum, where I learned to translate intricate technical concepts for a general audience.

## Pet Projects & Hobbies

I love pet projects as a way to try out new technologies and solve practical problems. For example, to simplify work for an editorial team, I built a Slack bot that transcribes any audio or video file into text. Another one is an AI agent which helps to craft episode descriptions and SMM posts. I most enjoy creating elaborate, digitally-powered quests for my friends' birthdays using Telegram bots, mixing storytelling with scavenger hunts through the city. I’m also training towards a 12k run, and trying to master the pigeon pose in yoga.
